## Description

- What was your motivation? The purpose of this project was to improve on the existing code without affecting the overall aesthetic and practicality of the existing app. This was accomplished by using the Semantic HTML style of coding. The purpose of using Semantic HTML style of coding is to make the app more accessible to all audiences, as it makes it easier for users and developers to distinguish components of the code, allowing for further improvements in the future. The use of "alt" text describes images within the app, for visually impaired users to obtain a description of the images. The new coding style also allows for more search engine results, which is important for the marketing and the potential growth of the organization.

## Usage

The use of "alt" text were added next to the images of the code for accessibility for the visually impaired. An example of what the "alt" texts may look like in the code is as follows: 
<img src="./assets/images/cost-management.png" alt="Three circles with a dollar symbol inside; a gear in the background"/>
This makes the app more accessible, and allows for more user friendly options in the event that the app image cannot be seen by the user.
    ```
